# grainflow basic granulator app
A basic application for granulation using my grainflow library for max msp

![grainflow preview](./previewImage.png)

please report any bugs or oddities in the issues section

This is a max msp project that can be compiled to an application for easy use and could also be easily ported to a max for live device.  I am hesitant on doing this because m4l does not handle poly~ multithreading very elegantly which would lead to a cpu bottleneck

based on the same work as the [Granflow](https://github.com/composingcap/grainflow) package for Max.
